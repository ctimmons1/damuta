Welcome to damuta's documentation!
==================================

**Damuta** is a Python library for exploring mutational signatures in cancer. Damuta requires only mutation type counts to get started. 

You can optionally provide: 
i) Custom signature definitions
ii) Sample meta-data, such as tissue type, data source, driver mutations, and more.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
